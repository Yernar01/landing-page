Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Highlighting

<mark>Highlight</mark> important text with `mark`:

```html
<mark>Highlighted text</mark>
```

## Callouts

Use [callouts]() (aka _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_) to draw attention to notes, tips, and warnings.

By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

```markdown
{{%/* callout note */%}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{%/* /callout */%}}
```

renders as

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

Or use the `warning` callout type so your readers don't miss critical details:

{{% callout warning %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

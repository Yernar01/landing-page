Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Video

Teach your course by sharing videos with your students. Choose from one of the following approaches:

{{< youtube D2vj0WcvH5c >}}

**Youtube**:

    {{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}

**Bilibili**:

    {{</* bilibili id="BV1WV4y1r7DF" */>}}

**Video file**

Videos may be added to a page by either placing them in your `assets/media/` media library or in your [page's folder](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/), and then embedding them with the _video_ shortcode:

    {{</* video src="my_video.mp4" controls="yes" */>}}

## Podcast

You can add a podcast or music to a page by placing the MP3 file in the page's folder or the media library folder and then embedding the audio on your page with the _audio_ shortcode:

    {{</* audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" */>}}

Try it out:

{{< audio src="ambient-piano.mp3" >}}

## Test students

Provide a simple yet fun self-assessment by revealing the solutions to challenges with the `spoiler` shortcode:

```markdown
{{</* spoiler text="👉 Click to view the solution" */>}}
You found me!
{{</* /spoiler */>}}
```

renders as

{{< spoiler text="👉 Click to view the solution" >}} You found me 🎉 {{< /spoiler >}}

## Math

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `{{</* math */>}}$...${{</* /math */>}}` or `{{</* math */>}}$$...$${{</* /math */>}}`, respectively.

{{% callout note %}}
We wrap the LaTeX math in the Hugo Blox _math_ shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown.
{{% /callout %}}

Example **math block**:

```latex
{{</* math */>}}
$$
\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}
$$
{{</* /math */>}}
```

renders as

{{< math >}}
$$\gamma_{n} = \frac{ \left | \left (\mathbf x_{n} - \mathbf x_{n-1} \right )^T \left [\nabla F (\mathbf x_{n}) - \nabla F (\mathbf x_{n-1}) \right ] \right |}{\left \|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \right \|^2}$$
{{< /math >}}

Example **inline math** `{{</* math */>}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{</* /math */>}}` renders as {{< math >}}$\nabla F(\mathbf{x}_{n})${{< /math >}}.

Example **multi-line math** using the math linebreak (`\\`):

```latex
{{</* math */>}}
$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}$$
{{</* /math */>}}
```

renders as

{{< math >}}

$$
f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}
$$

{{< /math >}}

## Code

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
    data.head()
    ```

renders as

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```

## Inline Images

```go
{{</* icon name="python" */>}} Python
```

renders as

{{< icon name="python" >}} Python
